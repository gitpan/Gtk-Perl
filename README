Note that there is a mailing-list foir discussions about
development of and with Gtk-Perl: gtk-perl-list@gnome.org.

Starting with version 0.7000 of this package, each submodule must be compiled
separately: this allows for greater flexibility and lower memory usage.
Gnome requires GdkImlib support build first.
To compile each package, run "perl Makefile.PL; make; make install" in each subdir,
starting from the base dir (the Gtk submodule, required by all the others).
At the time of this writing the submodules supported are:
./ (Gtk), GdkImlib, Gnome, GtkXmHTML, GtkGLArea, Glade.
See the INSTALL file for more details on installing this package.

This setup may require changes in the source code of existing programs, ie
if you need gdk-imlib support, you need to "use Gtk::Gdk::ImlibImage".
The same applies if you used gnome features without "use Gnome".

Also, starting with version 0.7000, info about flags and enumeration values are
retreived directly from gtk+ at runtime instead of relying on our .defs files.
This makes for faster startup and lower memory usage, but may introduce
some source incompatibilities: the only one I know of is the values of
Gtk::PackerOptions (pack-expand becomes expand now).

This module should compile with Gtk+ version 1.2.x, gnome version 1.0.x,
libglade version 0.11, gdkimlib version 1.9.x, gtkglarea 1.2.x.

Some of the information below may be out of date.

Usage information: this package was designed to work Gtk+ versions 0.99.10
through 1.2.3, though there is no guarantee it will work with any other
distributions, or indeed even those ones. To build, fully build and install
Gtk in your system (and glib too, if necessary), then run 'perl
Makefile.PL', and 'make test', and then 'make install' if all went well.

You may optionally run Makefile.PL with several different switches to enable
use of some Gtk widgets and Gdk functions available in those packages. These
switches are listed when you run Makefile.PL.

Gtk is available at <ftp://ftp.gimp.org/pub/gtk/>.

The code may very well still have leaks, and a few portions are incomplete
(such as Gdk colormap manipulation) and much of it is untested. No
documentation currently exists, but this code is designed to mimic the C
calling sequences as much as is reasonable.

A major file reorganization happened with 0.1.13, hopefully making the
module easier to work with, and add widgets to, but it may turn out to break
with older Perl installations. A configuration reorgnization occured after
0.3, to try and copy with supporting multiple Gtk versions.

If you have been using Gtk-0.1.8, several changes have been made to the API,
including the change of enumeration and flag values to lowercase (to match
the constants defined in gtk.defs), and the requirement for Gtk->init() to
be invoked before any other Gtk functions.

Please bring information regarding bugs and other issues to
<gtk-list@redhat.com> (before posting, you will need to subscribe to the
list by sending 'subscribe' to gtk-list-request@redhat.com) or the primary
author, at <kjahds@kjahds.com>. I cannot guarantee, at the moment, that any
particular problem will be fixed.

Good Luck,
Ken

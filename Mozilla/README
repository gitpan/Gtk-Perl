If you get a connection refused message when using the http
protocol or a blank page with ftp, it may be due to the fact
that loading a shared object (the mozilla componet) from a
non threaded program (perl) is not well supported (at least in
current GNU/Linux systems).
So you have three options:
1) Compile the Gtk and Mozilla Perl modules with a threaded Perl
2) Intercept http and ftp URIs and feed the mozilla widget with
the data yourself (using LWP, for example)
3) Use the LD_PRELOAD trick below

Set the env variable LD_PRELOAD to the current pthread implementation
and then start the perl script as usual:
$ LD_PRELOAD=libpthread.so.0 perl sample/test.pl

Since this is a hack its not known if it will work in the future
or on your system anyway. YMMV.

To install Gtk-Perl-0.7000:

 First install the Gtk part of the package by executing the following
 commands at your shell:

   $ tar -xvzf Gtk-Perl-0.7000.tar.gz
   $ cd Gtk-Perl-0.7000
   $ perl Makefile.PL
   $ make
   $ make install 

   *** NOTE *** : The 'make install' step must be performed as user root.

 To install any of the optional modules such as Glade, Gnome, GdkImlib,
 GtkGLArea, GtkHTML, or GtkXmHTML do the following:

   cd <module>           ( Where <module> is the name of the module
                           you wish to compile and install ).
   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make install 

   *** NOTE *** : The 'make install' step must be performed as user root.

 Repeat the above steps for each of the modules you wish to install on 
 your system. Any necessary build options can be appended to the
 "perl Makefile.PL" line. Currently recognized options are:

 Gtk:   --lazy-load  :  reduce initial memory usage and loading time, unstable
 Gnome: --with-panel :  turns on support for Gnome Panel applets.

  *** NOTE *** : GdkImlib MUST be compiled and installed BEFORE Gnome 
                 support may be installed. Please make sure you install 
                 GdkImlib first to make sure your Gnome support gets 
                 installed correctly.

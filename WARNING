 End Users: Nothing to see here, it's not a very important warning if you
 just want to build Perl/Gtk+. Please see README for more useful
 information.

 Developers: Please be very careful about 'make clean' if you are modifying
 this module. The cleaning process has been "adjusted" to properly clean up
 all the assorted junk that accumulates when this module is built, but there
 is a slight chance it is overzealous, and might remove a .c file that you
 intended to keep. If this happens (or you can prove that it can't), please
 tell me or fix Makefile.PL so that it doesn't do it again.
 
Thanks (and sorry for the inconvenience),
Kenneth Albanowski
